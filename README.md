# Harold Pimentel's VoiceCode configuration

These are my configuration files for [VoiceCode](http://voicecode.io/).
Most of them should work the box, but some of them depend on external programs.

In my experience, Atom seems to be the best editor for development with VoiceCode.

## Installation

Once you have VoiceCode installed, clone this at: `~/voicecode_user`
